#!./downloadXKCD_env/Scripts/python
# ^ sets script to run in virtual environment inside project directory.
# downloadXKCD.py - Downloads every single XKCD comic.
# version 1.2.1.devl
"""
Webscraper that downloads xkcd comics.
Uses multithreading, checks if comic already downloaded for increased
    efficiency on rerun.

Two run modess: Full and Quick
Full mode goes through every comic.
Quick mode checked latest 100 comics, quits when it reaches the
    first comic that is already downloaded.

1.2.0 changes:
    - implement json

1.2.1 changes:
    - refactored thread setup to separate quick/full modes
    - depreciate json title use in filename.
        revert to using file names from json as filename to save image
    - quick mode only downloads last 100 comics
    - modified run_mode to eliminate try/except necessity,
        added Q to quit option.
    - made default parameter download_comics: run_mode=True
        (for potential future use)
    - removed unused latest_comic param from comic_json

1.2.2 changes:
    - changed if/if not logic at start of threaded_download to if/else

    - #TODO add press x to exit for if __name__ == '__main__' script

    - #TODO: fix documentation all functions
